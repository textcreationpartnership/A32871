            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But now, in this Girls extremity, God, the great Phiſician, dictates unto her (thus, languiſhing in her miſerable, hopeleſs conditon,) what courſe to take, and what to do for a Cure; which was to go and touch the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> which the Girl told her Mother, that if ſhe could but touch the Duke, ſhe ſhould be well; Her Mother reprov'd her for her fooliſh conceit; But the Girl did often perſwade her Mother that ſhe might go to <hi>Lackington</hi> to the D.

Firſt, ſhe obſerved the Perſon of the D. to have knowledge of him, as he was paſſing by; ſhe preſt in amongſt the croud, and catcht him by the hand, his Glove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; and ſhe had a Glove likewiſe to cover her very ſores; She not being herewith ſatisfied with this firſt attempt of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Glove only; but her mind was, ſhe muſt touch ſome part of his naked fleſh; She waiting his coming forth, intended a ſecond attempt: The poor Girl, thus between Hope and Fear, waited his Motion; and on a ſudden was news brought of the D's coming, which ſhe (to be prepared) rent off her Glove that was clung to the ſores, in ſuch haſte, that ſhe tore her Glove, and brought away not only the Sores, but the skin. The Dukes Glove, (as Providence order'd it,) the upper part hung down, ſo that his wriſt was bare; she preſt on, and catcht him by the bare Hand with her running Hand; ſaying, <hi>God bleſs Your Greatneſs;</hi> and the D. ſaid, <hi>God bleſs You.</hi> The Girl was not a little tranſported with her good ſucceſs, came and told her friends that now ſhe ſhould be well; She came home to her Mother with great Joy, and told her ſhe had been toucht by the Dukes bare Hand, <hi>and that ſhe ſhould now be well.</hi> Her Mother hearing what ſhe had done, reproved her very ſharply for her boldneſs, and askt her how ſhe durſt do any ſuch thing? and threatned to beat her for it; She cryed out, <hi>O Mother, I ſhall be well again, and be cured of my Sores;</hi> And as God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty (the great Phyſician) would have it, (to the admiration of all that know or hear of it;) her ſix running Sores in her Hand and Arm, in four or five days were dryed up; the Bunch in her Breaſt was diſſolv'd in <hi>8</hi> or <hi>10</hi> days, of which now is no ſign; Her Eye that was given for loſt, is now perfectly well, and the Girl in good health; the Marks of her ſeveral Sores are yet viſible in her Hand and Arm; all which hath been diſcovered to Us both by Mother, Daughter, and Neighbours that know her.</p>

               <p>THE Extraordinary Cure of the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> lately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by his Grace the D. of <hi>M.</hi> in his Weſtern Progreſs, has (no doubt) alarm'd many People, and open'd the eys of the moſt Unbelieving, to ſee Heaven by this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle proclaim his Legitimacy, and God Almighty declare for the <hi>Black Box.</hi> Neither has there been wanting a ſecond Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to this Illuſtrious D's Family, in a Cure both as ſtrange and as true as the former; that ſo according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Out of the mouth of Two or Three Witneſſes; every word might be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> Siſter to this moſt Excellent Prince, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but ſince (by the convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and exemplary Piety of her Husband Mr <hi>F.</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Requeſts,</hi>) brought over to his Religion, I mean the true ſincere <hi>Proteſtant Faith,</hi> has been as remarkable in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cure of the ſame malignant Diſtemper, as the D. her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The truth of which whole matter of Fact, We whoſe Names are under-written engage our ſelves to be reſponſible for. Now the matter of Fact was thus; One <hi>Jonathan Trott</hi> was born of poor, but virtuous Parents; his Father was dead but his Mother that ſurviv'd, by the Bleſſing of God accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying her honeſt Endeavours, had got together a ſum of Money very conſiderable to the Trade ſhe drove, her chief Vocation being ſelling of <hi>Apples, Pears, Oranges,</hi> and other <hi>Fruit,</hi> not far from <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Church Dore; the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of which Calling ſhe ſtill imploy'd in being very buſie with her Needle in footing Stockins, mending Breeches, and ſuch like honeſt Labours. But her greateſt affliction was, the ſad ſad ſpectacle of the poor wretch her only Son and Heir, (the aforementioned <hi>Jonathan Trott,</hi> who had for many years, been ſore afflicted with a continual Running of a moſt noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Matter in his Neck, and many other parts of his Body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed often with ſo great Tumours and Swelling about his Throat, as almoſt choak'd him. Upon this Son of hers, (now about the Age of 19.) ſhe had ſpent the greateſt part of her Livelihood, to pitiful, Quacking, Ignorant Phyſicians ſuch as her Purſe could beſt procure, and ſuch as kill the poor at the moſt eaſie and conſcionable Rates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe her Doctors could never rightly inform her what was her Sons true Diſtemper; till at laſt ſhe her ſelf (ſuſpecting it was the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi>) had the Advice of ſome able Phyſicians, as Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> Dr. <hi>Minſhel,</hi> &amp;c. who all agreed that it was the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> and that he was in very great danger, unleſs he were very ſpeedily touch'd. This happned to be when His Majeſty was laſt at <hi>Windſor,</hi> whither ſhe (good woman) was deſigning her Journey with her Son; But the night before ſhe reſolv'd on her Progreſs, ſhe dreamt that ſhe heard a Voice that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her Son to be Toucht by Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> The poor woman you may imagine, was infinitely ſurpriz'd at this Command, never having ſo much as heard of ſuch a Woman as Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> in her Life; But ſhe was much more aſtoniſht when her Son came to her, and told her that he was reſolv'd not to take his Journey to <hi>Windſor,</hi> for that he had heard a Voice that Night three times ſucceſſively, [which by the Deſcription he gave of it, was the very ſame that his Mother had heard, and commanded the ſame thing,] telling him, that one Touch of Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> would make him whole. Upon this the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man acquainted ſeveral of her Neighbours with the unuſual Circumſtances of her Dream, ſo exactly concurring with her Sons; and by them was inform'd that there was ſuch a Lady, Siſter to His Grace the D. of <hi>M.</hi> whom they therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be the Perſon intended in the Dream, by reaſon of her near Relation to His Grace, and the Crown. The Youth <hi>Jonathan</hi> hearing this, was extreme glad, and ſhew'd violent ſigns of it, in urging and preſſing his Mother as vigorouſly as ever he could, to procure her leave; who at firſt was very unwilling to let him go upon this Adventure. He ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon one Argument which even in affliction made the poor Woman ſmile, That [having heard of the D. of <hi>M</hi>'s Cure, which was known long before it was Publiſhed,] He did not know why Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> might not receive from her Mother the Curing of the Ills of Young Men by a Touch of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Fleſh, as well as the D. her Brother had from his Father
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48172:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Curing of Young Women by a Touch of His. However, his Mother having check'd him for this ſaying, was reſolv'd to ſend him: Accordingly he went to Mrs. <hi>Fanſhaw</hi>'s Houſe near St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and having deſir'd admiſſion, as ſoon as ever Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> appear'd, he falls down upon his Knees before her, begging Pardon for boldneſs, the occaſion whereof he told her in the Relation which he made of all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to his Mother and Himſelf: Then graſping her hands with all the Violence and Paſſion imaginable, kiſs'd them a thouſand times, and directed them (for the Lady was not ſo Uncharitable as to deny it upon any ſuch good account,) to his Neck, and his Throat, and all the other parts of his Body wherein he was afflicted; which ſhe vouchſafed to ſtroke, wiſhing withal, that it might do him as much good as he believ'd it would. This done, ſhe left him, and the Youth went home v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry well ſatisfy'd with the Hopes of his being very ſpeedily Cur'd, as accordingly it ſucceeded; For within Three or Four Days time, his Running ceaſed; And in a Weeks time, the Swelling in his Throat was not only abated, but Perfectly and Intirely Cured; And Mrs. <hi>F.</hi> by many of this Perſons Neighbours and Acquaintance, (and moſt of the <hi>Apple-women</hi> about theſe Parts,) is to this day called <hi>Princeſs F.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is well known, That this Guift of <hi>Healing</hi> was firſt imparted to King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> a Good King, though a <hi>Popiſh Saint,</hi> to Deſcend upon his <hi>Legitimate Succeſſors;</hi> And if none of them ever Exerciſed it before They came to the Crown till now, we muſt either ſay; that They had it, but forbore the Uſe of it; Or elſe we muſt admire the Excellency of the Advantages that <hi>Protestant Princes,</hi> and <hi>Princeſſes</hi> have above thoſe formerly that were <hi>Papiſts;</hi> Since <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though Two or Three Removes from the <hi>Crown,</hi> can do as much with a Touch, as <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> when He was not only a <hi>King</hi> but a <hi>Saint.</hi> And now who is there that can Queſtion the <hi>Legitimacy</hi> of our moſt Excellent Prince <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>M.</hi> when this Remarkable Witneſs that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath given Him and his Siſter of Curing the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> pleads ſo loudly in his behalf?</p>
               <p>There is but One Other Natural Argument to prove the Legitimacy of this <hi>Prince,</hi> and his being the True and Right <hi>Succeſſor;</hi> And that is the Inſtinct by which <hi>Lyons</hi> are taught to Reverence, and to do them Homage; without ever hurt-them; And This too I am told His Grace does deſigne to ſhew the World in his own behalf; For it is Credibly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that on <hi>Saturday</hi> next the D. of <hi>M.</hi> deſigns to be ſhut up with one of the Greateſt <hi>Lyons</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> There to be ſeen, to the great Satisfaction of all that behold how Secure He muſt needs be of his <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> that dares put it to ſo Dangerous a Tryal; Sir <hi>Th.
